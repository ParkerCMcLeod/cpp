Errors: 

    Compile Time Errors: Violations of the language found by the compiler.
        
        Syntax Errors
        Type Errors
    
    Link Time Errors: Errors found by the linked when trying to combine object files into an executable.

    Run-Time Errors: Errors found by checks in a running program.

        Errors detected by hardware/OS
        Errors detected by libraries
        Errors detected by user code

    Logic Errors: Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.

Program Error Default Assumptions:

    1. Should produce the desired results for all legal inputs.
    2. Should give reasonable error messages for all illegal inputs.
    3. Need not worry about hardware bugs and misbehavior (out of our scope).
    4. Need not worry about system software bus and misbehvaior (out of our scope).
    5. Is allowed to terminate after finding an error.

Cause of Errors:

    Poor specifications of behavior - describe your program before.
    Incomplete programs - look at all cases.
    Unexpected arguments passed.
    Unexpected program inputs.
    Logical errors!

Use callee checks! The function being called is responsible for reporting them!

Error handling limimtations:

    Can't modify the library.
    Performance - costs more than worth to check.

Exceptions: If a function finds an error that it doesn't know what to do with, it throws an exception - indicating what is wrong. 
            If the function is in a try-catch block, it will move on to the catch section. Otherwise it stops the program execution.

out_of_range exception is often thrown.

<> are called template arguments.
