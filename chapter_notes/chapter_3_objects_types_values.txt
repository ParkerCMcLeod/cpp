Introduction to storing and using data.

An object is a region of memory with a type - specifying the information contained within it. 
A named object is a variable.

Using a var uninitialized is not type safe. Initialize them. 
Only possible exception is with vars being set from input.

Not all conversions betweens variable types are safe. A common issues is "narrowing".
It is when you put a type like double (8bytes) and try to place it in a char (1byte).
