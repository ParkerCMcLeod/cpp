Writing hello world program and setting up an environment. Run before you can walk. 

The "source code" and "program text" are compiled into "object code".
The object code is ".o" in Unix and ".obj" in Windows.

The seperate parts of code are called "translation units". Examples of this are "hello_world.cpp" and "std_lib_faciliites.h".
The translation units are linked together by the "linker". 

Steps are as follows:
    1. Source code file is compiled into object code (hello_world.cpp -> hello_world.obj) by the C++ compiler. 
    2. The object code is linked with other object code (hello_world.o + ostream.o -> hello_world.out) from the included translation units by the C++ linker.

Note: object code AND executables are not portable amoung systems. 

Errors can be classified as follows (from easiest to hardest to fix*):
    compile-time errors
    link-time errors
    run-time/logic errors
